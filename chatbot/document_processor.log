2024-11-12 14:31:02,484 - document_processor - ERROR - Error getting embedding: 

You tried to access openai.Embedding, but this is no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0 - see the README at https://github.com/openai/openai-python for the API.

You can run `openai migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase to use the 1.0.0 interface. 

Alternatively, you can pin your installation to the old version, e.g. `pip install openai==0.28`

A detailed migration guide is available here: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742

Countless patients have ex pressed the gratitude for the opportunity to receive CBT, \nmany observing that, for the first time in their lives, they have developed strategies \nand tools for managing their mood, solving their life problems, and enhancing quality \nof life. Use of an active , structured treatment approach such as CBT allows for the \nefficient treatment of patients, which not only helps patie nts to see change in  \ntheir lives rather quickly, but also allows therapists to se e more patients because the \ncourse of treatment is time-limited. As a result, therapists and patients, alike,  \ndevelop a renewed sense of hope and optimism for treatment success.', 'Core \nbeliefs are addressed using the downward arrow technique, understanding the benefits \nand costs associated with such be liefs, and using reframing strategies to adopt more \nhelpful beliefs. CBT focuses on resolving a patient ’s current problems and aims to \nteach effective problems-solving skills. During the later phase of treatment, the CBT therapist and her patient review progress \ntoward the treatment goals established during the initial phase of treatment, \nsummarize and consolidate the skills learned during the middle phase of treatment, \nand plan for the continuation or termination of treatment. We hope this manual will be  helpful to clinicians new to CBT, as well as to those \nwho are interested in enhancing their CBT skills. Although the primary aim of this \nmanual has focused on the treatment of depression, it is our expectation that the core \nCBT competencies described in this manual can be adapted and applied to treat other \nmental health and behavioral health conditions.', ', 1989), that it is equally as effica cious as psychotropic medications in the short \nterm, and that it is more efficacious than psychotropic medications in the long term \n(see Hollon, Stewart, & Strunk, 2006, for a review). There is a great deal of research \nsupporting CBT’s efficacy for treating an array of mental disorders using both \nindividual (Butler, Chapman, Forman, & Beck, 2006) and group (Craigie & Nathan, \n2009) formats. Organization of This Manual \nThis manual is organized into five main parts: (a) cognitive behavioral theory  and the \nmanner in which the theory translates to treatment, (b) CBT session structure , (c) \ninterventions that take place in the initial phase of treatment, (d) interventions that \ntake place in the middle phase of treatment, and (e) interventions that take place in the \nlater phase of treatment.'], Sources: ['cbt-d_manual_depression.pdf', 'cbt-d_manual_depression.pdf', 'cbt-d_manual_depression.pdf']

In such instances, pe riodic summaries allow for time \nfor both the patient and therapist to reflect on the problem and may facilitate \nengagement in the therapeutic process.
